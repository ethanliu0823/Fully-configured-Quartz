# Fully-configured-Quartz

This project is a smart extension to .net libirary Quartz, you will like it.
As a .net or java developer, sometimes using an efficient third party libiray or package to achieve some functions is esiential. Sometimes we need automatic timing excute ours tasks, Quartz.net or Quartz is a good choice. Unfortunatelly, even though powerful function it has, we also write too manycode to implement the interface named IJob.Using this extension I achieved, you just need config one kind xml file. Maybe you need to do two kinds thing: treating data or send messages, so it has two kinds xml,pls use you need.
