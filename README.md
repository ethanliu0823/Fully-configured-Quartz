# Fully-configured-Quartz
这是一个扩展了Quertz.net的项目，希望你能喜欢它。使用它连最基本的代码都不用写了，只需要配置我新建的xml结构。
this project is a smart extension to .net libirary Quartz, you will like it.
As a .net or java developer, using an efficient third party libiray or package to achieve some functions is essiential. Sometimes we need automatic timing excute ours tasks, Quartz.net or Quartz is a good choice. Unfortunatelly, even though powerful function it has, we also write too manycode to implement the interface named IJob.Using this extension I achieved, you just need config one kind xml file. Maybe you need to do two kinds thing: treating data or send messages, so it has two kinds xml,pls use you need.
